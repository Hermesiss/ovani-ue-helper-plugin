# Ovani Sound Unreal Engine Helper

## What is it?

This is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that helps to work with Ovani Sound [Unreal Music Plugin](https://ovanisound.com/products/unreal-audio-plugin)

## Why?

I don't want to create MetaSound files manually for every music folder

## How to install

Copy to /Plugins folder and enable in project settings

## How to use

1. Copy some music from Ovani Sound to your project. It should have these files:
   - `[Music_File]_Cut_30`
   - `[Music_File]_Cut_60`
   - `[Music_File]_Intensity_1`
   - `[Music_File]_Intensity_2`
   - `[Music_File]_Main`
2. Right click on the folder with music in Content Browser and select "Create Sound Source" in "Ovani Sound" section
3. Check the created MetSound file in the same folder
